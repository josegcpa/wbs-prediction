# A complete computational assessment of the cytomorphological determinants of myelodyplastic syndromes

## Motivation

This is the repository for [PLACEHOLDER](). In this work, we use the whole blood slides of >300 individuals with myelodyplastic syndromes and anaemias and use them to develop a method that is capable of predicting a disease and retrieving examples of cells which are relevant for each classification.
