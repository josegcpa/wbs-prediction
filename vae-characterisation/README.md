# Characterisation of blood cells using a Beta-VAE

Uses the implementation in [PyTorch-VAE](https://github.com/AntixK/PyTorch-VAE) (all models, `experiment.py` and `run.py` are from there, changes in `experiment.py` and `run.py` were made to include the possibility of using larger images (128*128)) with a few minor tweaks to characterise blood cells detected in whole blood slides.
